onlce downloaded go to the path and cmd and enter below command

java -jar jarname.jar or .war

it will run and and show the message as Jenkins is up and running in the below

Now got to browser and ente the url :  http://localhost:8080/


It would ask the passsword to access the jenkins (That password would reflect on the same command prompt and This may also be found at: C:\Users\w138720\.jenkins\secrets\initialAdminPassword)


Now paste the password on jenkins broswer 


It ask you select the plugins. click on it



Now Will an sample demo java program(Notepad) to jenkins worskspace by manually


TO creat an new job==>


T0 set global configuration like jdk ==> http://localhost:8080/manage/configureTools/


below the jdk set the home and path:

JAVA_HOME
jdk path

and click buildsteps as ==> select windows batch command shell ==> and 
enter the executing command 
javac filename.java 
java filename

==> save and apply


Build the item and check whether its built succesfully

Now goto the workspace path ==> C:\Users\w138720\.jenkins\workspace\JavaDemoclass and copy the class

now save the file inside the created jenkinjob


path ==> C:\Users\w138720\.jenkins\jobs

copy and paste the java file in that path 


Now click the item and build it and now click the and build and and click on the console output and see the message of the output


To schedule period time, So that test run on like alarm


click==>workspace or job==> configuration ==> build configuration==> click build periodically-->

to set an period in format then refer this site ==> https://crontab.guru/

**** ==> every min every hour and eveyedaya and month 
0 22 * * 1-5 ==> this means ==> At 22:00 on every day-of-week from Monday through Friday.


To schedule an build of project2 build which based on other project1 build 

create a new item and copy and paste the java class in that workspace and add build steps

while in build trigger checkin the Build after other projects are built? 

and enter ther exixting project name which u want to be the run after 


How to trigger build when any commit pushs happens in github

We need to download https://ngrok.com/download and install and extract it and Sign it in webpage of ngrok

after extracting open the ngrok or in cmd

enter in the command like ngrok http 8080 (8080 is localhostserver)


C:\Users\w138720\Downloads\ngrok-v3-stable-windows-amd64>ngrok http 8080

it would provide an url with prefix of fowarding and click it 

once u laucnhed the url jenkins would open in this url like local host 

note down that url.


Also we need to git plugin for jenkins

now goto Jenkins ==> manage jenkins==> plugins==> available plugins ==> type git ==> and check in the git server and install

Adding path to jenkins:

Click manage jenkins ==> git installation==> name as default or something and path should end with .git.exe like "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe"

apply and save


Now Need to add the git repo in jenkins

in item ==> configuration ==> source managemnet ==> checkin as git and paste the https url of git repo and select repo credentials (Optional)

 and select build trigger as "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling"

Now need to configure webhook in github

goto repo===> /settings/hooks/new ==> payload url==> enter the url provided by hgrok as above and add / webhook-git

content type as application wwwform and something


and select Which events would you like to trigger this webhook? as Just the push event. and click Addwebhook




Deploying the webapp (War file) in server (Tomcat) manually

intall tomacat in machine and extract 

We already using jenkins in localhost 8080 . we need to configure diffrerent port for tomcat

tomcat ==>  conf ==>server.xml

in the <connector port ="8080"...

tomcat==>bin==> startup (Window batch fil)

It would open an command prompt 

now go to chrome and enter the url http://localhost:8081/

it would open tomacat webapp


Now adding war file to tomcat
download any webapp from github and extract it look for war file or goto the project path and open cmd and enter the below command

mvn clean package  --> this would create an war file in the target directory

copy the .war file and paste it on tomcat==> webapp and paste it

now goto the browser http http://localhost:8081/warfilename



Deploying war file in jenkins

We need an pluging called git with container in jenkins 

download and restart


adding credentials in tomcat

Tomcat==>conf==> click tomcat users.xml

on that paste <role rolename="manager-script"/>
<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<role username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-script,manager-gui"/>

inside </tomcat-users> and save

need to remove an error causing thing from tomcat (Important)

tomacat==>webapp==>manager==>meta-inf==> open context.xml

in that xml find the <context tag and remove the value until hasmap in inside the </contxt> tag 


creat an item and goto postbuild steps

enter the war file name like WebApp.war

contex path as WebApp

Container as TOmcat 9.x (diff in version)

credentials ==> add ==> select admin (What we configured in xml file of tomcat)


and enter the tomcatUrl -==> http://localhost:8081/


Now paste the .war file in the jenkins workspace path

Now build the item and go to local 8080 and 

http://localhost:8081/webApp(war file name)
